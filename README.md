# My Daily Phone Notes

A personal tracker for logging daily notes straight from my phone.

I’m always on my phone managing school, 4 kids, appointments, reminders, and classes. This project helps me keep track of what I’m doing, reflect on my progress, and build motivation through little check-ins.

## Why This Project?
- Lightweight and easy to update from anywhere
- Keeps a simple log of what I actually accomplished
- Helps track patterns, effort, and small progress that would otherwise get forgotten

## Files
- `daily_log.csv`: Main log of daily entries (Date, Win)
- `.gitignore`: Prevents clutter from accidental files later
- `README.md`: This file

## Future Ideas
- Add 30-day summary reports
- Create visual charts or dashboards (Power BI, pandas)
- Tag entries by category (school, health, parenting, etc.)
- Add optional journal entries in a second markdown file

## Created & Maintained on Mobile
This entire project was built on my Google Pixel—from folder setup and CSV creation to uploading files and committing via browser and GitHub app.

## What I Learned
- How to create and upload a full GitHub project using only my phone
- What it means to "seed" a dataset for testing and early visualizations
- The difference between mobile-first workflows and laptop-based GitHub projects

## Challenges I Faced
- Learning that the GitHub mobile app doesn’t allow repo creation or file uploads
- Figuring out how to use the browser version of GitHub on my phone instead
- Navigating limited file upload options and finding ways to access the correct files on Markor text editor app
- Understanding how to avoid breaking `.csv` formatting when adding commas or line breaks in entries from keepnotes app
